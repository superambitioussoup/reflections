When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Remote repositories are great when working from a different computer or if your
own computer crashes. It is also a great way to share your work with others as
opposed to having everyone access your own local computer???

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Well you may not what the changes present on the remote repository (someone else made changes or you might have put it in a bad state?). And when would you automatically stay up-to-date? Every commit? What if that conflicts with what you are working on currently locally?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Branches are local and represent when a “Deviation” or “Change” from the “main” code.

Clones is a complete copy of a repository and can be local only or local and GitHub.

Forks on the other hand is GitHub’s version of clone  for local. So end result is two copies of the same repository (I guess except the forked repository has reference back to the original repository if need be)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
